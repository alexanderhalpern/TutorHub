# Winner of Best Solo Hack at LexHacks 2022.
# TutorHub
TutorHub provides College students with easy and instant access to professional tutors. The website features support for MIDI keyboards, meaning that music tutors can plug in a musical keyboard and have their keypresses be displayed in realtime to the student to follow along. 

# Notes
Due to the time constraints of the hackathon I did not have time to break down the code into components, so it is comprised of one large file.

# Technologies
* ReactJS
* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* Socket.io
* Simple-Peer (for peer2peer communications)
* Firebase Realtime DB
